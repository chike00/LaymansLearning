# LaymansLearning

These are a collection of my website - (LaymansLearning)'s source code for public preview.

--------------------------
The aboutme.html and aboutme.css files come together to create a page detailing who I am and why I do this. I tried to make use of typography and artistic inspiration which I had gained from other sites to do this. I made use of CSS3 gradients and also animations to do so.
